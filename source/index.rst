Welcome to WGDI's documentation!
================================

Description
-----------
::

WGDI (identification of whole-genome duplication), a python-based command-line tool that allows researchers to gain insights into \
recursive polyploidization and doing cross-species genomics alignment analysis. \

The WGDI suite provides commonly used dotplot, ks, and collinearity analysis workflows together with tools for modeling and visualization, 
rendering these analyses accessible to genomics researchers in a convenient manner. \

The use of WGDI can produce a gene-colinearity supported and hierarchical list of homologous genes, relating to specific polyploidizations and speciations. \

WGDI also provides additional functions to help polyploid distinguish between subgenome and ancestral genome reconstruction and other evolutionary scenarios. \

WGDI outperforms similar tools in terms of efficacy, flexibility, scalability. WGDI is freely available for public use at |github|_.\
