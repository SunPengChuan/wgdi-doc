**Common file**


* conf

The conf file contains the parameters required for the corresponding operation, which are read when WGDI is performed.
Using ``wgdi -* ? > *.conf`` to get the configuration file in the current directory and modify it to run.
If you don't know which files are needed, you can view it through ``wgdi -* ?`` or ``wgdi -* help`` , or ``wgdi -* example``. These three commands are equivalent.

In conf file: **gff1** , **lens1** , **genome1_name** and **gff2**,  **lens2**, **genome2_name** represent the files of species 1 and 2 respectively. 
We will no longer explain these in this documentation

*  The explosion is the output file of the `blast+ <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/>`_ , available in  -6 outformat.


**Tips**

* You can use ``wgdi -conf ? > total.conf`` generates a **total.conf** file with all parameters, and when you modify the parameters and run WGDI, WGDI will only read the parameters corresponding to the total.conf file to execute your command.

* When a folder runs WGDI, WGDI automatically generates results for you in the background, and you can exit the folder and go to the next folder to start working.

* WGDI performs the **conf** file for the current folder, so you can copy the **conf** file in bulk and make parameter modifications that apply to the target folder.
