Welcome to WGDI's documentation!
================================

Description
-----------
::

WGDI (Whole-Genome Duplication Integrated analysis), a Python-based command-line tool that facilitates 
comprehensive analysis of recursive polyploidization events and cross-species genome alignments. 
WGDI supports three main workflows (polyploid inference, hierarchical inference of genomic homology, 
and ancestral chromosome karyotyping) that can improve the detection of WGD and characterization of WGD-related 
events based on high-quality chromosome-level genomes. Significantly, it can extract complete synteny blocks and 
facilitate reconstruction of detailed karyotype evolution. This toolkit is freely available at 
GitHub (https://github.com/SunPengChuan/wgdi).
