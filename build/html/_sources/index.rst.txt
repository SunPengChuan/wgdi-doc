Welcome to WGDI's Documentation!
================================

Description
-----------

WGDI (Whole-Genome Duplication Integrated analysis) is a Python-based command-line tool designed to facilitate comprehensive analysis of recursive polyploidization events and cross-species genome alignments. It supports three main workflows:

- Polyploid inference
- Hierarchical inference of genomic homology
- Ancestral chromosome karyotyping

These workflows improve the detection of whole-genome duplications (WGD) and the characterization of WGD-related events based on high-quality chromosome-level genomes. Importantly, WGDI can extract complete synteny blocks and aid in the reconstruction of detailed karyotype evolution. The toolkit is freely available on GitHub: `GitHub <https://github.com/SunPengChuan/wgdi>`_.
